# Tic-tac-toe game in C++

This project is something I did for my resume. I started this project in 2020 and finished the AI portion of it. As of 2022, I have recently modified the code and added a few more features. Features include the ability to play against a human and an AI that is easy to beat. The current game features include multiplayer and against the computer. The multiplayer is between two human players. Whoever decides to go first is Player 1, and then second is Player 2. Then, the computer mode, which has two modes itself. One is easy mode, where the computer is beatable. The other one is hard mode, where the computer is unbeatable.

## Why I did this Project?

After finishing high school, I had free time during the summer of 2020, so I decided to learn C++. Once I gained the basic knowledge of C++, I chose to do this project. Frankly, this is my first project as a Computer Science student I did. It was a bit challenging at first. Challenges often in errors and design problems. Eventually, I overcame those obstacles and made the code work. Also, this project taught me a few things about the C++ language and overall improved my problem-solving ability.
